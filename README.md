# Credit_Risk_Analysis
## OVERVIEW
This challenge uses different types of machine learning to complete an analysis on credit risk based on provided data, and predict future applications.

## RESULTS
- Naive Random Oversampling had a balanced accuracy score of 0.674, high risk precision was 0.01, low risk precision was 1,  and sensitivity score average was 0.74.
- SMOTE Oversampling gave us an accuracy score of 0.662, high risk precision was 0.01, low risk precision was 1,  and sensitivity score average was 0.63.
- Undersampling had a much lower accuracy score of 0.544, high risk precision was 0.01, low risk precision was 1,  and sensitivity score average was 0.67.
- Combination sampling gave us an accuracy score of 0.662, high risk precision was 0.01, low risk precision was 1,  and sensitivity score average was 0.73.
- Balanced random forst gave us an accuracy score of 0.789, high risk precision was 0.03, low risk precision was 1,  and sensitivity score average was 0.70.
- Easy ensemble gave us an accuracy score of 0.93, high risk precision was 0.01, low risk precision was 0.99,  and sensitivity score average was 0.70.

## SUMMARY
It appears as though the majority of the data falls under the low risk category. Easy ensemble had the best accuracy rate, and would be the recommended model.
